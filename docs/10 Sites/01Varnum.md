* Approximately 80 000 people are connected to municipal water in Borås.
* Present water reservoir (Öresjö) is exposed to large risk due to roads, railroads, and industry.
* Groundwater is convenient and cost-effective.
* In 1992, a groundwater exploration was conducted throughout the municipal and adjacent area, in order to identify important groundwater assets and possible surface water reservoirs.
* A more detailed study was conducted in 1998, where areas of artificial infiltration (from surrounding lakes) was sought after.
