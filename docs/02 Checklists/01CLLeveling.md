# Field Methods Checklists - **Levelling**

## Equipment
* Surveying instrument
* Staff, staff level
* Tripod

## Directions
- [ ] Install the instrument at a distance to the measurement point, adjusting the bull’s eye spirit level such that the bubble is centered
- [ ] The assistant (A) sets staff on measurement point and holds staff steady, centering the spirit level’s bubble.
- [ ] The surveyor (S) takes a first reading, an intermediate shot (IS). The acronym IS and the measurement is noted.
- [ ] The A moves the staff to the next measurement point or turning point (TP) while the surveying instrument remains at its location. A TP is a point at which an elevation with a FS is established and a back shot (BS) will subsequently be taken.
- [ ] The S takes a front shot (FS) to determine the elevation at the TP. It is noted with the acronym FS
- [ ] The S moves the instrument to a point between TP and next measurement point while the A holds the staff at the same location.
- [ ] After adjusting the instrument, the S takes a BS and records the measurement with the acronym BS.
- [ ] In this manner measurements are carried on.
_Some hints:_
- [ ] Try to keep the distance between BS and FS equal to compensate for reading errors.
- [ ] On side-hill setups, place one leg on the uphill side and other two on the down-hill side.
- [ ] Use hand level to check for proper height of the setup before precisely levelling the instrument.
