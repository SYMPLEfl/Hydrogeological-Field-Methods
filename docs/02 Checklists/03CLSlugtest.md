# Field Methods Checklists - **Slugtest**

## Checklist for Slug test with solid bailer:

- [ ] Measure groundwater level with electrical measuring tape (or comparable device)
- [ ] Install the pressure transducer with data logger sufficiently below the groundwater level (at least 2 meters)
- [ ] If using a bailer (solid material to replace the water), mark the lenght of the wire from the top of the observation until the bailer reaches the water table.
- [ ] Lower the bailer carefully in order to avoid that it getting stuck (e.g., if the observation well is not alligned; Some piezometers are bent or have decreasing diameters with depth.)
- [ ] Then further lower the bailer such that it is completely below the water table. Try to lower the bailer instantaneously.
- [ ] Wait until the groundwater level gets back to the steady state. If you dont have access to online measurements wait for approximately 10 min. If you have online measurements and the water table is not reacting, wait for at least 5 min. 
- [ ] Remove the bailer instantaneously from well
- [ ] Record the groundwater level for a sufficent amount of time (with online measurement until the groundwater level is back at steady state level or wait for at least 5 min.If you dont have access to online measurements wait for approximately 10 min.
