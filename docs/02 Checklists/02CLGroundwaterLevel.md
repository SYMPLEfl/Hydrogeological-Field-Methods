# Field Methods Checklists - **Groundwater Level Measurements**

## Checklist for electric measuring tape:

- [] Check if light/sound of measuring tape is functional.
- [ ] Run tape down the well, be careful not to cause wear on the cable at the well head. Well casing often has sharp metal edges.
- [ ] Ensure that you have found the exact level, by pulling cable up and finding the water level a couple of times.
- [ ] Note level at the highest point of the well casing, time, well name, operator and comment any irregularities or other useful information.
- [ ] Measurements are always related to the top of the piezometer, (see “measuring point” in Figure 25) never to land surface. If piezometers are skew (often the case for bedrock wells, or after being hit by a tractor ….) you need to decide where to take the reading (the presumably highest point) and mark it.
- [ ] Do not leave the dipper immersed in water longer than necessary

## Pressure transducer (PT):

- [ ] Connect a barometric pressure transducer to computer and open control software
- [ ] Set starting time for measuring barometric pressure
- [ ] Connect PT to control software
- [ ] Enter name of measuring point, measurement interval and starting time for measuring groundwater pressure
- [ ] Measure depth to water table in well with EMT
- [ ] Consider possible groundwater level fluctuations, and range of PT before deciding on length of wire to connect it to. 
- [ ] Fasten wire at PT and well head securely
- [ ] Install barometric diver
- [ ] Lower PT into well
