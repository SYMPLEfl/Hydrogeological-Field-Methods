# Field Methods Descriptions - **Pumping Test**

In order to explore the hydrogeology of a study site, one of the most important field method is the pumping test. It helps answer questions, such as:
* how much groundwater can be extracted from a certain aquifer?
* Where does the groundwater come from?
* How high is the permeability of the aquifer?
* Etc.

In order to acquire this information, the production well is pumped at a defined (constant) rate, while recording the groundwater level response (drawdown) in one or more observation wells. The response data can subsequently be used to delineate the aquifer boundaries and evaluate aquifer characteristics, such as transmissivity and storativity.
