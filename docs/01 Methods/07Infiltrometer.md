# Field Methods Descriptions - **Infiltrometer**

The double-ring infiltrometer is used when trying to measure the infiltration rate of a soil at nearly saturated conditions. Water is supplied to the inner ring at constant head, i.e. the amount of water in the inner ring is held constant. The total water consumption is recorded over time which can then be related to the infiltration capacity, i.e. the maximum infiltration rate of the underlying soil. The purpose of the outer ring is to compensate for propagation of lateral flow and ensure 1-dimensional vertical flow in the inner ring. 
It should be noted that setting up the double-ring infiltrometer deforms the soil and introduces cracks that can lead to a modified infiltration capacity. Macropores, cavities in soil larger than 0.08 mm, can additionally increase the infiltration rate. The infiltration rate measured with a field method, like the double-ring infiltrometer, should be repeated at different locations and interpreted as an estimate.
