# Field Methods Descriptions - **Slug Test**

In cases where the aquifer material has low permeability or other economic or time-relating constraints apply, pumping tests are often not the best choice for aquifer testing. In that case, a slug test can be conducted. By instantaneously (or decreasing -> bail test) pressure in a suitable groundwater observation bore and measuring the response over time, transmissivity and storativity of the aquifer - in the vicinity of the well - can be determined.

Different types of slugs can be used, e.g.,
* a “water slug”, where the pressure change is induced by adding water.
* Alternatively, a solid rod/pipe can be used that displaces water in the well (falling head slug test).

In a bail test or rising head slug test, water or an object is abstracted from the well. The main requirement is to induce the pressure change as quickly as possible.
