# Field Methods Descriptions - **Groundwater Level Measurements**

Groundwater levels are generally assessed by measuring water levels in wells. Several different methods for measuring groundwater levels exist. Depending on the type of well, requirements for measurement interval and accuracy, water quality concerns, project scope or resources, the most appropriate method(s) have to be chosen. During the field exercise, we will use two methods:
* pressure transducer (PT) with automatic level logger (often called “Diver”, which is the product name of a PT by NovaMetrix), and
* electric measuring tape (EMT).
In order to be able to evaluate the measured groundwater table, a fixed reference point that is usually surveyed beforehand, must be known at the well head. The accuracy of EMT is about 1 cm for 100 meters, but dependent on the measuring range for PT.
